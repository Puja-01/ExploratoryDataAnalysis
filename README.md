# Exploratory Data Analysis: Logistic Regression on Student Test

## Project Overview

This project focuses on performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) and building a logistic regression model to predict student test outcomes based on given features. It demonstrates how data preprocessing, visualization, and machine learning techniques can be applied in an educational context.

## Key Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, feature scaling.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Visualizing relationships between variables using plots and charts.
- **Model Building**: Implementing logistic regression using Python.
- **Evaluation**: Assessing model performance with accuracy, confusion matrix, and other relevant metrics.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Open `Logistic Regression.ipynb` using Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
4. Follow the notebook cells to explore the analysis and results.
